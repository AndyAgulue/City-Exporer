# City Explorer

**Author**: Andy Agulue
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are building an application that gets weather information and displays it by city

## Getting Started

Determine your file structure:
    -data
      -location.json
      -weather.json
    -.env
    -readme.md
    -.gitignore
    -.eslintrc.json
    -package.json
    -server.js
Create your server
link your files appropriatly 


## Architecture
node
npm
express
## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:



## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
02-22-2021 7:31pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
02-22-2021 9pm - Application has an express server, weather info isn't uploading
Leaundre Mckinney was a huge help with everything

In labs 6 through 9, you will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. You will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Every day you will have a new partner. You and your new partner(s) will spend the first 45 minutes reviewing each other’s code from the previous day and planning out the days work on the whiteboard.

Draw the web request response cycle for the task at hand (about 15 minutes).
Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
Outline the functions that support this data flow.
Do a formal code review of each person’s code (15 minutes each).
Open your partner’s GitHub Pull Request on your laptop.
Identify an area in the code that:
you don’t understand
or seams overly complex
or you see a way to improve
or you want more information on
or you really like or think is interesting
Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.
You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

You will have access to view the code base for the client, but will not be able to modify it in any way.

For this lab assignment, you will convert a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then use those values to request weather information for that location. As your City Explorer back end progresses in labs 6 through 9, you will use the latitude and longitude to request information from other APIs from the same search query.
